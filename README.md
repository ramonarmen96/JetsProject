### My OOP Jets
### Description
The Jets Application is designed to list different aircrafts (Helicopters
and Planes) There is a menu that populates prompting the user list all aircrafts
and gives the option of giving the Flight time, list all aircrafts, list fastest
, list farthest traveling aircraft, and the option to add or remove an aircraft
to the list.

run in Terminal

### Lessons Learned
I need more practice calling methods in other Classes. Runway and Vertical
were pretty much the same in just the way that longest and farthest, and add and
remove Jet were the same.
